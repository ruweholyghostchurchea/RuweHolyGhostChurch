            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>The Ruwe Holy Ghost Church of East Africa (RHGCEA) is an indigenous Roho (Holy Spirit) church. Our movement originated among the Luo of Nyanza and Western Kenya and is now present in Tanzania, Uganda and many other countries.</p>
            <p>Our narrative is defined by a sequence of prophetic revelations that began in the early 1907. This history was sealed by dramatic episodes of repression and martyrdom at Musanda in January 1934, which became the central founding History of our church.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>To embody the living power of the Holy Spirit (Roho) by spreading the Gospel through the power of the Roho, healing the sick, and building faithful communities in East Africa and beyond.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>To see the prophecies of our founders fulfilled: a self-reliant, educated, and spiritually vibrant community that stands as a beacon of Roho faith, building institutions that uplift our people and honor God.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">The RHGCEA is currently led by the Fourth Archbishop, Daniel Were Ohola (b. 1944).</p>
            <p>Archbishop Ohola has led the church since late 2002. His leadership emphasizes the preservation of our sacred Dhoroho liturgy and the faithful observance of our annual commemorations. He represents the church in ecumenical and public fora and engages with government and other churches on civic matters. Under his leadership, church elders have increasingly sought to preserve our oral histories, hymns, and distinct liturgical texts.</p>
