        <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Our church is built on the ministry and sacrifice of two central figures:</p>
        
        <div class="cards-grid">
            <div class="card dark">
                <h3>Alfayo Odongo Mango (c.1884 ‚Äì 1934)</h3>
                <p>He is the Founder of all Roho Churches, including the Ruwe Holy Ghost Church EA. Born circa 1884, he was an Anglican catechist before a powerful spiritual transformation. His ministry emphasized healing the sick, interpreting visions, and organizing prayer assemblies. His authority rested on claimed revelations and his ability to produce the coherent liturgical corpus of Dhoroho (hymns and prayers).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card dark">
                <h3>Lawi Obonyo Ongwek (c.1904 ‚Äì 1934)</h3>
                <p>Known as 'the Helper' (Jakony), Lawi Obonyo was a close relative and immediate follower of Mango. He was a key miracle-worker and charismatic young man (He is known for his quick response to call for the Good News about Roho. He even started spreading Roho Gospel when Alfayo Mango was still doubting). Before dedicating his life to the gospel, he worked as a Carpenter at Maseno.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card dark">
                <h3>Kingi Elija Oloo (d.1939)</h3>
                <p>On 15th January 1934, Elijah Oloo, an ex-army sergeant, was symbolically installed as the Kingi Mar Jorateng‚Äô (also known as ‚ÄúKing of the Black‚Äù) at Alfayo Odongo Mango‚Äôs home in Musanda. The coronation, conducted by Alfayo Odongo and other Roho leaders, marked an important effort by the Roho Church leadership to establish a new administrative and spiritual structure among the black faithful. It is said that during the coronation, Elijah Oloo received 300 strokes of the cane, signifying purification and endurance. The following morning, a tri-coluor flag (black, white, and red) was raised.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Flag-Raising (January 16, 1934)</h3>
            <p>Under the leadership of King Elijah Oloo, followers raised a tri-color flag (black-white-red) as an act of religious identity and to symbolize that the end of colonial rule had begun.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>The Musanda Martyrdom (January 20-21, 1934)</h3>
            <p>Tensions with neighboring groups and colonial authorities erupted in war. Assailants burned 17 houses in Alfayo Odongo's homestead, killing people inside and spearing others.</p>
            <p>These deaths are commemorated as martyrdom, and this sacrifice became the central founding myth that legitimized Ruwe as the headquarters for the movement.</p>

            <p>In the aftermath of the massacre, the surviving Roho adherents regrouped at Ruwe. Barnaba Waluoho Ojoro (c.1898 ‚Äì 1980) emerged as the key organizer. He was chosen by the elders to lead the community's reconstruction and became the first bishop of the Ruwe Holy Ghost Church.</p>
            <p>Bishop Barnaba is credited with consolidating liturgical practices, preserving the Mango-era hymns, and establishing Ruwe as the headquarters. He also formalized the registration of the church in Kenya in 1972.</p>
